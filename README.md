# Colosseum Chronicles
Colosseum Chronicles is a Unity based video game project.
In this game you are a prisoner in a colosseum who have to fight for survival. But instead of fighting with your fists, you fight with magical creatures which are your minions. You can eggs and several other items in the Black Market, and you can also drop eggs, from which your creatures come, by fighting the creature you want an egg for.
Gameplay wise it's a Rock-Paper-Scissor type game in which your have 5 diff√©rent action that have different interactions between each other.

This project is on hold (and mostly abandonned) since several years.
